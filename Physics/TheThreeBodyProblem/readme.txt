In physics and astronomy: 
The three-body problem is a mathematical 
problem in classical mechanics. 
It asks: given the initial positions and velocities 
of three celestial bodies (like stars or planets) 
that interact with gravity, what are their motions 
over time?

This problem is much harder than predicting the 
motion of two bodies, like a planet orbiting a star. 
That's because the gravitational pull of each body 
constantly affects the others, and these effects 
can amplify over time. 
Even with powerful computers, scientists can only 
find approximate solutions for most three-body 
problems.
