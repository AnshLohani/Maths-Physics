1. Engine Configuration and Design
    Number of Cylinders: Inline-4, V6, V8, etc.
    Firing Order: Factory-determined sequence.
    Engine Size (Displacement): Fixed by manufacturer design.
    Forced Induction: Turbocharged or naturally aspirated setup.
2. Exhaust System Design (Factory Components)
    Exhaust Manifold/Headers: Factory length and design.
    Exhaust Pipe Length and Diameter: Standard sizing from the manufacturer.
    Muffler Design: Factory-installed mufflers.
    Catalytic Converters: Required for emissions compliance.
    Resonators: Typically included in stock systems.
    Material: OEM choice, usually stainless steel or mild steel.
3. Exhaust Flow Dynamics
    Backpressure: Set by factory system design.
    Flow Rate: Dependent on factory exhaust setup.
    Pulse Timing: Inherent to engine and manifold design.
4. Engine RPM
    Higher RPM: Affects tone as part of the engine's natural operation.
    Lower RPM: Produces a deeper note in stock configurations.
5. Combustion Characteristics
    Compression Ratio: Set by engine design.
    Fuel Type: Gasoline or diesel as per factory configuration.
    Air-Fuel Ratio: Managed by stock ECU programming for efficiency/emissions.
6. Vehicle-Specific Factors
    Chassis Resonance: Factory body structure and materials.
    Placement of Exhaust Exit: Determined by vehicle design (rear, side, etc.).
    Noise Insulation: Stock cabin soundproofing.
7. Environmental and External Factors
    Surroundings: Not part of the car but impacts perception.
    Temperature and Air Density: Natural, external influence.
8. Vibrations and Harmonics
    Harmonic Resonance: Factory-tuned natural frequencies.
    Material Thickness: OEM materials used in the exhaust system.
