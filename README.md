# Math-Physics

Exactly what's written in the title! This project is all about Physics and maths. It started in high school as a simple project to visualize what my teachers used to teach, since then I got interested in how I can visualize those concepts, more an more!




## Physics
This is where all the "Physics" programs are stored. Firstly this project will work on Mechanics and Electromagnetism consisting of Electostatics, Current, Electronic Devices and their features, Magnetism, AC/DC and Electromagnetic Induction. And some concepts of mechanics like Mechanical Visualization on different surfaces, Rotational Mechanics etc. The list goes beyond!!
## Roadmap

- Create a web support system.

- Work on making the already existing code more efficient.

- Add more project files, take referenece from "TO-DO Section"


## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

See `readme.txt` created for each project we are working on!

Keep it friendly, add value and please NO VOCABULARY COMMITS!!


## Tech Stack

**Language:** Strictly should be **Python**

**Libraries Used:** matplotlib, numpy, math, random, turtle.


## TO-DO

- A simulation of ball on a wedge (mechanics - Laws of Motion).
- Stress-Strain on an object (Graphically and Visually )
- Electric Field Visualization :
       
        - Due to single charge 
        - Diapole
        - Continous System of charge on an equation provided (eg: A parabola)
